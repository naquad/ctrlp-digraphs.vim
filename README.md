# CtrlP Digraphs

CtrlP extension for fuzzy-searching digraphs.
May be used instead of `:digraphs` / `<C-V>` combination, which
shows known digraphs and allows you to enter them via <C-V>.

## Prerequisites

[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) should be installed

## Usage

Plugin provides `CtrlPDigraphs` command which will
pop up a list of available digraphs.

**Note:** it is recommended to have `multi_byte` support to get more digraphs.
